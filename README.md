'''
Purpose: This is a two-player mathematical game of strategy. It is played by two
people with a pile of coins (or other tokens) between them. The players take turns removing
 coins from the pile, always removing a non-zero square number of coins (1, 4, 9, 16, â€¦).
 The player who removes the last coin wins.
